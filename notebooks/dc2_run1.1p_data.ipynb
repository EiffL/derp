    "Now we let's query the catalog for all objects in the region of interest with magnitude `r<27.0`.  This query functions like any other GRC-based catalog query with one exception.  The truth catalog is ultimately stored as a sqlite database.  This means that all `native_filters` (filters applied directly to the catalog's native quantities), should be phrased as strings which could be inserted into an SQL `WHERE` clause.  Because the `native_filters` are applied when the quantities loaded into memory (as opposed to `filters`, which are applied after the quantities have been loaded), we want these to be as restrictive as possible so as to limit the memory consumption of the loaded catalog.  The sqlite databases are indexed on `star`, `agn`, `sprinkled`, `healpix_2048` and `object_id`.\n",
